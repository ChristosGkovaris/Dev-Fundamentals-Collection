# DEV FUNDAMENTALS COLLECTION

This repository gathers a broad set of programming exercises, algorithms, and small projects implemented in multiple languages. It reflects hands-on practice across different paradigms—procedural, functional, logic-based, object-oriented, and scripting—covering essential concepts from algorithms to UI design.

## OVERVIEW

This collection includes solutions, experiments, and algorithmic implementations developed throughout coursework and personal study.  
Each language folder contains standalone code samples showcasing different problem-solving techniques, from AI search algorithms to functional transformations, data structure implementations, and UI components.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a unified reference for exploring fundamentals across a variety of languages.
